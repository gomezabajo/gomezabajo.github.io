abstract: One of the most time-consuming task for teachers is creating and
  correcting exercises to evaluate students. This is normally performed by hand,
  which incurs high time costs and is error-prone. A way to alleviate this
  problem is to provide an assistant tool that automates such tasks. In the case
  of exercises based on diagrams, they can be represented as models to enable
  their automated model-based generation for any target environment, like web or
  mobile applications, or learning platforms like Moodle. In this paper, we
  propose an automated process for synthesizing five types of diagram-based
  exercises for the Moodle platform. Being model-based, our solution is
  domain-agnostic (i.e., it can be applied to arbitrary domains like automata,
  electronics, or software design). We report on its use within a university
  course on automata theory, as well as evaluations of generality, effectiveness
  and efficiency, illustrating the benefits of our approach.
